# MedVision Project - Synthetic Data Generation for Eczema in Dark Skin using DCGAN

This repository contains code for the research project: MedVision - **"Assessment of Eczema in Dark Skin using Generative AI (DCGAN): Synthetic Data Generation for Clinical Training"**.

## Project Overview

The project is focused on using AI to generate a synthetic dataset for training nursing students to diagnose eczema and jaundice dark skin complexions.
Identifying eczema in dark skin remains a significant challenge in clinical practice due to the scarcity of representative medical images. To address this, an AI model based on **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs)** is developed to generate a diverse dataset of dark skin tones with various eczema and jaundice conditions. The model was fine-tuned to synthesize realistic images of eczema in dark skin complexions. The synthetic images generated by this project are intended to:

- Enrich datasets for model training
- Support clinical education, especially for training new nurses 
- Enhance AI fairness in dermatology
